JavaScript / HTML5 Flod 1.0
===========================

This is a JavaScript port of my AS3 Flod library, it currently works only in Chrome (I've used version
17.0.942.0 to develop it), hopefully in the future other browsers will add support for the Web Audio API.

It took a lot of effort to reach this stage so if you want to use it in any commercial production I'll ask
you to mention the proper credits and to make a donation to: chreil@hotmail.com via PayPal, thank you.

This version will replay the following music formats using the Web Audio API:

* FastTracker II XM
* The Ultimate Soundtracker
* DOC Soundtracker 9, DOC Soundtracker 2.0
* Master Soundtracker
* Soundtracker 2.3, Soundtracker 2.5
* NoiseTracker 1.0, NoiseTracker 1.1, NoiseTracker 2.0
* His Masterâ€™s NoiseTracker
* ProTracker 1.0, ProTracker 1.1, ProTracker 1.2
* SoundFX 1.0, SoundFX 1.8, SoundFX 1.9, SoundFX 2.0
* FutureComposer 1.0, FutureComposer 1.2, FutureComposer 1.3, FutureComposer 1.4
* SidMon
* SidMon II
* BP SoundMon 1.0, BP SoundMon 2.0, BP SoundMon 3.0
* DeltaMusic 1.0
* DeltaMusic 2.0, Delta Music 2.2
* Digital Mugician 4 & 7 Voices
* David Whittaker

Example
-------

*Simple Way* (Include everything)

Include http://telamon.github.com/FlodJS/1.0/flod-min.js

      <script src="http://telamon.github.com/FlodJS/1.0/flod-min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

Play file from url

      var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
      xhr.open('GET', 'http://example.com/my_cool_tune.xm', true);
      xhr.responseType = 'arraybuffer';
      xhr.onload = function(e){
        if(this.status == 200){
          var xmplayer = window.neoart.F2Player(null);
          xmplayer.load(this.response);
          xmplayer.play();
        }else{
          alert('No mod found at URL');
        }
      }

*Usual Way* (Pick your formats)

You can include just the player(s) you need in your page just remember that all the Amiga players needs
the Core.js and the Amiga.js files too and the PC player (FT2) needs the Core.js and the Soundblaster.js files.

Example, including the ProTracker player:
	Core.js
	Amiga.js
	PTPlayer.js

including the FastTracker II player:
	Core.js
	Soundblaster.js
	F2Player.js
